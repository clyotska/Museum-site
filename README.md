# Museum-site
The final project, I made during basic frontend courses. It was made with bootstrap.
## To get it working
Download all the files here in one folder. It's local site, so it's not hosted anywhere. For it to work you should place all the files in **one folder**. 
## Why bootstrap?
I don't know JavaScript, but I want my site to have nice animations and look neat. Bootstrap is easy to use and it looks clean. 
#### P.s
I made this project in 2022, if I recall it correctly. So there are already a few design decisions that I would've definetly changed, if I was working on it now. But I decided to leave it as it is. 
I hope it will work on your device and you would like it!!
